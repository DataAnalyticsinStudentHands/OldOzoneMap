SUMMARY
These files are used only for the "pull" data requests from TCEQ and for archiving old logs and data. The folder also includes configuration and source files for "openconnect", a command-line tool Mark has installed for use by the "pull" scripts. The scripts were originally called via cron jobs under Mark's user account:
