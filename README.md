# Introduction
This document should help to understand the technical background of a website/data environment that we know as HoustonCleanAirNetwork or HCAN. It has been established through an effort by the Honors College at the University of Houston with funding from the Houston Endowment in 2010. It is currently available under <http://www.houstoncleanairnetwork.org>.
